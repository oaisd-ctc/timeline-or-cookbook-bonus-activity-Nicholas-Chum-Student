            <h2>Green Curry Creation Step-by-step</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Toast white peppercorn, corriander seeds, and cumin seed until fragrent</li>
            <li>Pour your freshly toasted spices into a mortar and pestle and begin to grind and stir the seeds until they become a fine powder (cover with hand if needed)</li>
            <li>Keep them into a different plate and then chop up some green peppers and put them into the mortar</li>
            <li>Also put shallots/garlic, galangal, kafir lime leaf, coriander root, and lemon grass into mortar</li>
            <li>Continue to mash them together and when almost done, add shrimp paste and then continue</li>
            <li>Now to the pot, add oil and then your store-bought coconut oil (3 large spoonfuls) and stir a little</li>
            <li>Then add the green curry paste and chicken thighs (not chicken breasts) and fish sauce and then stir some more</li>
            <li>Add thai eggplants, thai basil, red chilis, bamboo shoots, and kafir lime leaves (all cleaned) and then stir some more</li>
            <li>If the curry is too dry, add chicken stock (not water cause water has no flavor) and then stir some more</li>
            <li>Add brown sugar and then stir some more</li>
            <li>When almost done taste and make sure it's perfect, if needed, add more fish sauce or other ingredients</li>
            <li>To finish it up, add MSG to increase the flavor and umami of the green curry</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and serve hot and enjoy!</li>
