            <h2>Pho Noodle Creation Step-by-step</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Prepare sliced meats, seafood, and vegetables</li>
                <li>Begin boiling a pot of water</li>
                <li>In one pot, prepare your broth, adding whatever you want such as bones, your own seasoning, and other delicious ingredients - if you add vegetables, only add solid, large ones (nothing small like mint)</li>
                <li>Leave that to cook for 30 mins to an hour or until boiling</li>
                <li>Prepare a second pot of boiling water</li>
                <li>When the second pot is boiling, take your rice noodles and plunge them in with a strainer to carry them</li>
                <li>After about 15 to 20 seconds, take them out and put them in your bowl</li>
                <li>Place your thin vegetables and meats into the bowl with your noodles</li>
                <li>Bring your bowl to your soup broth and proceed to introduce it to your noodles</li>
                <li>Let it soak into your noodles giving it flavor, and cook the other meats and vegetables</li>
                <li>When done, turn off the fire on the soup and you can dump the starchy water away</li>
                <li>For now, add ingredients such as hoisen sauce, siracha, soy sauce, and other delicious spices into your pho</li>
                <li>Enjoy and make sure to clean up afterwards!</li>
