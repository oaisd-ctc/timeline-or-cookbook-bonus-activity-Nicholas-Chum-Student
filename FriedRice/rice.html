            <h2>Fried Rice Creation Step-by-step</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Prepare your rice (1 day old rice), vegetables (peas, corn, etc.), 4-6 eggs, and chicken (cubed chicken breast)</li>
                <li>Begin cooking by adding some oil and then cooking the chicken first</li>
                <li>Cook chicken until the outside is cooked and then set aside</li>
                <li>Cook eggs until scrambled and then set aside</li>
                <li>Cook the vegetables until soft and then set aside</li>
                <li>Pour the rice in, cook until extremely slightly brown, then begin adding vegetables, eggs, and chicken</li>
                <li>Cook for a while while constantly even to ensure that all the rice is evenly cooked</li>
                <li>Add sauces such as soy sauce to the side of the pot so it flows in and covers it well</li>
                <li>Add salt, sugar, and other spices that you might desire</li>
                <li>Cook for a while longer and when done, plate and enjoy!</li>
