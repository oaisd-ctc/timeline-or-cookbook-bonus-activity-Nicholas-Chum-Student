            <h2>Egg Roll Creation Step-by-step</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the filling by adding ground beef, shredded carrots, and other meats and vegetables into the bowl</li>
            <li>Stir and add any spices that you would want as well</li>
            <li>When ready, also prepare some egg yolk to use it to seal the egg roll</li>
            <li>Prepare by taking your egg roll wrappers and unwrapping the wrapper off (keep them together though and use TYJ Spring Roll Pastry)</li>
            <li>Take one at a time, lay it out, and put 2-3 inches of filling on one corner horizontally</li>
            <li>Roll the filling along with the corner to the half way point, at which you should fold the two horizontal corners in</li>
            <li>Continue rolling until there is about 1-2 inches left at the end</li>
            <li>At which, put some egg wash on it and close it up</li>
            <li>Finally when all of them are made, fry and enjoy with any sauce you want!</li>
